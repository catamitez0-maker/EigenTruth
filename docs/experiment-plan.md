# EigenTruth Experiment Plan

A gated experiment program: each borrowed idea (math, physics, frontier-problem) gets one
small experiment with an explicit accept/reject criterion. Ideas that pass become tool
features; ideas that fail are documented as negative results. The goal is a complete
representation-observability toolkit spanning **training and inference**.

逐个分析、逐个实验、按判据决定进库或砍掉。负结果同样写入文档——这是工具的诚信资产。

## Ground rules

- Every experiment must run on **CPU, 8 GB RAM** (gpt2 / tiny models). Anything needing a
  bigger model is run as a mechanism check here and flagged "replicate on larger hardware".
- One experiment → one focused PR. Tests + lint green before merge.
- Each experiment states: **Question / Method / Accept criterion / Deliverable / Cost.**
- Priority order = information value ÷ cost. Phase 1 experiments are independent and can
  be reordered freely.

## Phase 0 — Finish in-flight work

### E0. Linear direction vs Mahalanobis + layer sweep (real data)
- **Question:** Is the contrastive-direction projection (`truth_proj`, mass-mean probe)
  a stronger detector than `maha_last`? Which layer is best?
- **Method:** Code already in working tree (`benchmarks/eval_truthfulqa.py --sweep`).
  Run on gpt2, full TruthfulQA split as before.
- **Accept:** n/a (measurement, not a gate). Whatever wins becomes the documented default.
- **Deliverable:** Updated `benchmarks/README.md` results + default-signal/layer guidance;
  commit to the open eval-harness PR.
- **Cost:** ~5 min CPU. **Status: code ready, needs the run.**

## Phase 1 — Validate each math borrowing (independent, reorderable)

### E1. Conformal prediction → calibrated thresholds
- **Question:** Can split conformal turn raw scores (maha / truth_proj) into p-values with
  honest finite-sample coverage, replacing hand-picked thresholds?
- **Method:** Implement split-conformal calibration over a held-out calibration set; on the
  TruthfulQA eval split check empirical coverage at nominal 80/90/95%.
- **Accept:** |empirical − nominal| coverage ≤ 3% across the three levels.
- **Deliverable:** `eigentruth.eval.conformal` (or `Manifold.calibrate()`) + tests.
- **Cost:** low (pure CPU, ~50 lines + tests). **Highest value/cost in the plan.**

### E2. Random matrix theory → principled spectrum tools
- **Question:** Does the Marchenko–Pastur noise floor + eigenvalue shrinkage (Ledoit–Wolf
  style) beat our fixed relative ridge, and give a principled effective-rank signal?
- **Method:** (a) Plot manifold covariance spectrum vs MP bulk for gpt2 activations; count
  out-of-bulk spikes. (b) Swap fixed ridge for Ledoit–Wolf shrinkage; re-run E0 AUROC.
  (c) Synthetic collapse data: check spike-count/effective-rank monotonicity.
- **Accept:** AUROC not worse AND scale stability preserved; rank signal monotone under
  synthetic collapse.
- **Deliverable:** `Manifold.spectrum()` (eigvals, MP edges, n_spikes, eff_rank) +
  optional shrinkage mode.
- **Cost:** low-medium.

### E3. Bures–Wasserstein distance → manifold-to-manifold metric
- **Question:** Is closed-form 2-Wasserstein between Gaussians the right metric for
  comparing manifolds (checkpoint diff, drift)?
- **Method:** Implement BW distance; unit-test metric properties on synthetic Gaussians;
  sanity-check on gpt2: distance matrix across layers should show adjacent-layer locality.
- **Accept:** metric axioms pass; layer-distance structure is coherent (adjacent < distant).
- **Deliverable:** `manifold_distance()` in core + tests. Foundation for E5/E8.
- **Cost:** low.

### E4. Intrinsic dimension → cheap layer-selection signal
- **Question:** Does the TwoNN intrinsic-dimension profile across layers reproduce the
  literature shape, and does it predict the best monitoring layer found in E0?
- **Method:** Implement TwoNN; compute ID per layer on gpt2 activations; compare ID
  profile against E0's per-layer AUROC; also score ID as a 6th detector signal.
- **Accept:** ID profile qualitatively matches literature (rise→fall) AND (ID-selected
  layer is within top-3 of E0 sweep OR ID signal AUROC > 0.55).
- **Deliverable:** `eigentruth.eval.intrinsic_dimension` + layer-selection heuristic doc.
- **Cost:** low-medium.

## Phase 2 — Tool-composition experiments (combine validated bricks)

### E5. Training telemetry callback (training-side axis)
- **Question:** Can streaming per-layer stats (norm, mean drift, eff-rank from E2, BW
  distance-to-init from E3) visibly distinguish a healthy fine-tune from a pathological one?
- **Method:** `RepTelemetryCallback` for HF Trainer; fine-tune a tiny model twice on CPU —
  clean data vs corrupted (heavy label noise / duplicated data); compare telemetry curves.
- **Accept:** at least one telemetry curve cleanly separates the two runs before eval loss does.
- **Deliverable:** `eigentruth.training` module + demo notebook/script + tests.
- **Cost:** medium. Depends on: E2 (rank), E3 (distance) preferred but not required.

### E6. Model-collapse early warning (synthetic-data loop)
- **Question:** Does representation diversity (eff-rank / ID) decay monotonically when a
  model is iteratively trained on its own outputs, and earlier than visible quality loss?
- **Method:** tiny model; 3–5 generations of self-output fine-tuning; track E2/E4 signals.
- **Accept:** diversity signal decays monotonically across generations.
- **Deliverable:** collapse-detection demo + doc section. (Frontier problem: synthetic data.)
- **Cost:** medium. Depends on: E2 or E4.

### E7. Generation-trajectory convergence monitor (reasoning-direction seed)
- **Question:** During generation, does hidden-state trajectory convergence (step-to-step
  displacement decay; optional Koopman-style rate estimate) correlate with output
  confidence/quality?
- **Method:** gpt2, per-token last/mid-layer states over generations; correlate convergence
  metrics with answer NLL/entropy and TruthfulQA labels.
- **Accept:** |Spearman| > 0.3 with confidence, or AUROC > 0.55 as a detector signal.
- **Deliverable:** `TrajectoryMonitor` prototype. Flag: replicate on a reasoning model
  (R1-distill class) on larger hardware.
- **Cost:** medium.

### E8. Concept registry + multi-probe (platform glue)
- **Question:** engineering, not science — can multiple (manifold, direction) pairs be
  saved/versioned/loaded and monitored simultaneously with a clean API?
- **Method:** registry format (.pt + metadata), multi-probe attach, docs.
- **Accept:** API review + tests; example with two concepts monitored at once.
- **Deliverable:** `eigentruth.registry`. Foundation for BYO-concept use.
- **Cost:** medium. Independent.

## Phase 3 — Consolidation and release

### E9. Prune and rename
- Act on accumulated evidence: demote/remove hyperbolic HSE from the default path
  (current evidence: no lift over Euclidean); generalize naming
  (`Manifold`/`Direction`/`Probe`, keep `Truth*` aliases); reposition README as a
  representation-observability toolkit for training + inference.

### E10. Release 0.2.0 + honest writeup
- Package, publish, and write up every experiment **including negative results**.
